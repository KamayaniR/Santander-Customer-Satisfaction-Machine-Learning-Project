# Santander-Customer-Satisfaction-Machine-Learning-Project

## Overview
The objective of this project is to predict customer satisfaction levels using a highly anonymized tabular dataset provided by Santander Bank. The challenge involves:
 - Thousands of anonymized features
 - Strong class imbalance (only a small % of unsatisfied customers)
 - No business feature names or domain metadata
This project focuses on using a Decision Tree classifier for its transparency, simplicity, and ease of interpretation, while exploring hyperparameter tuning and feature selection to improve performance and generalization.
